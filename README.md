# Posts List - Next.js 13 & TanStack Query Project

Welcome to the Posts List project! This exercise demonstrates how to fetch blog posts from a database and display their information using Next.js 13 and TanStack Query. It's a simple web application that allows you to browse through a list of blog posts.

## Requirements

To run the Posts List project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 12.0.0)
- npm (>= 6.0.0)

## Installation and Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RichardAnthonySanchez/nextjs-reactquery-postslist.git
   cd posts-list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration:**
   Before running the application, make sure to set up the database URI. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project and adding the following line:
   ```
   DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri_here
   ```

   Replace `your_database_uri_here` with the actual URI of your database.

## Usage

To run the application and access the homepage with the list of blog posts, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Once the development server is up and running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the listed blog posts.
